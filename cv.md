3. My goal is to become a man which can do something *more* than just sitting and eating. 
I want to learn something that will help me to become a professional, who may probably 
teach someone else one day.
4. I learnt C++ at the university.Moreover i learnt C in some kind.
7. Now I am a second year student at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of BSU.
8. First i stydied english at school, where we had some kind of british textbooks.
That gave me the base to learn english more. Now I learn english by watching films on
english and sometimes communicating with some people by english while playing computer games.
